	<a name="freeagent"></a> Signing up as a free agent</h2>

<p>If you want to sign up as a free agent and be placed into a team by Heroes Lounge you can click the "Sign up as a free agent!" button instead!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Making a new team</h2>

<p>Even if you are already on an existing Amateur Series team, you can still make a new team for the ARAM tournament. This could be helpful if not all of your current team wants to participate in the ARAM League. All you need to do is press the "create a new team" link on the tournament page, then you will be able to add people as wanted to your team. For full details on how to add people to your team, please check out <a href="https://heroeslounge.gg/guides/signup-guide#ownTeam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">our Amateur Series Guide for creating a new team</a>. Don't worry if you can't get 5 players, Heroes Lounge will top your team up for you so you have enough to play!</p>
