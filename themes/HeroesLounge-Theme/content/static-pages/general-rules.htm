Whichever comes first. After this point, the team with the technical difficulties must decide to either forfeit the map or continue the map (with a bot in the case of a disconnect). Directly after a map ends, teams are allowed to have a break of a maximum of 5 minutes to sort out anything they have to before starting the next draft.
