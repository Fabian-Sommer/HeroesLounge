<h1>Method Mayhem Heroes of the Storm</h1>

<p>Method Mayhem is a monthly tournament series organized by Method in collaboration with Heroes Lounge for the EU region focused on the highest level of players in Heroes of the Storm. Every month will start with 3 weekly cups where teams can participate to earn points to qualify for the monthly tournament. The best 8 teams based on points from the cups will qualify for the double-elimination monthly tournament. Every weekly cup has its own prize pool separately from the monthly tournament. There is a starting prize pool for both the cups and monthly tournament, that through the form of crowdfunding will be increased.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Method is more than an esports team, Method is a global media &amp; entertainment brand focused on delivering an engaging, memorable and most importantly, entertaining consumer experience.</p>

<p>Heroes Lounge is a home for everyone with an interest in playing Heroes of the Storm competitively. We believe that everyone should have a chance to experience the thrill of competition at their own level.&nbsp;</p>
