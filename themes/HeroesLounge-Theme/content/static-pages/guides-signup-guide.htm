<h1 dir="ltr"><strong>Heroes Lounge sign-up process</strong></h1>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Hello and welcome from the Heroes Lounge team. So you have found yourself playing and enjoying Heroes of the Storm. You were also wondering how to take the enjoyment of the game to the next level? Well look no further, you have come to the right place.</span></p>

<p>The following guide will show you the step by step process of how to join the biggest HotS amateur gaming community worldwide, whether you’re one of the recently arrived North American subspecies of sloth or a European sloth looking to experience HotS the way it was meant to be played.</p>

<p><span>It doesn’t matter whether you’re a lone sloth looking for a team, a small group or an entire family of 5 or more sloths, we have an option for you to play in a cooperative environment in our competitive league regardless.</span></p>

<p>There are several ways to participate in Heroes Lounge, which we will guide you through in the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr"><span><a href="#ownTeam">Make your own team</a></span></li>
	<li dir="ltr"><span><a href="#existingTeam">Participate on an existing team</a></span></li>
	<li dir="ltr"><span><a href="#freeAgent">Join up as a free agent and be placed into a team</a></span></li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2 dir="ltr">Creating an account</h2>

<p dir="ltr"><span>You have already successfully completed the first step by visiting</span><a href="https://heroeslounge.gg/">&nbsp;<span>heroeslounge.gg</span></a> and finding this guide!&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>To participate in a Heroes Lounge season you will need a couple of things to make it possible for us to give you a fair and balanced environment to play in.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">First up, you need your battle.net ID. Additionally, as we use HotsLogs MMR for our balancing (aka rigging), you are required to have linked your battle.net account with HotsLogs and set your profile to public there.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info text-center mt-1" style="width:100%"><span class="font-weight-bold">Note:&nbsp;</span>The battle.net ID MUST be your main account, smurfs or alternative accounts are not allowed for fairness reasons.</div>

<p dir="ltr">Additionally, you need a Discord account with which you can join our Discord server. This will help you get in contact with the community, find a team, participate in the league and spam endless sloth memes in one of our many Discord channels.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info text-center mt-1" style="width:100%"><span class="font-weight-bold">Note:&nbsp;</span>Please be aware that the Discord tag is case sensitive! If your account doesn't properly link to Discord, first check if that is exactly as it appears in Discord itself.</div>

<p dir="ltr">
	<br>
</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>With those two things ready and lined up, you can now create an account on our website through the prominently placed sign-up button.</span></p>
<hr>
<figure class="figure"><img src="/storage/app/media/Pages/Guides/Signup/0.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded fr-fic fr-dii"></figure>
<hr>

<p dir="ltr"><span>In order to register, you need the aforementioned accounts as well as a valid email address and a password. Make sure you have access to the email account, as you will need to confirm your address before you will be able to log in to your account. After a short welcome message and the aforementioned email verification, you’ll be good to go.</span></p>
<hr>
<figure class="figure"><img src="/storage/app/media/Pages/Guides/Signup/1.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded fr-fic fr-dii"></figure>
<hr>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The first thing you’ll see is your account settings. On the ‘General’ tab, you can change your username, password, and email address as well as sign up for the Heroes Lounge newsletter. You're safe to do so, the newsletter will only be used to inform you of important events like a new season starting or similar.</span></p>
<hr>
<figure class="figure"><img src="/storage/app/media/Pages/Guides/Signup/3a_general.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded fr-fic fr-dii">
	<hr>

	<p dir="ltr"><span>The ‘Media’ tab allows you to customize your player profile with an avatar and banner image. Please refer to the size recommendations for best results on that.</span></p>
	<hr>
	<figure class="figure"><img src="/storage/app/media/Pages/Guides/Signup/3b_media.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded fr-fic fr-dii"></figure>
	<hr>

	<p dir="ltr"><span>The ‘Social’ tab lets you add a description to your profile as well as add links to various social media that people can then find on your page. <strong>Most importantly, you can change your selected region and set a country here.</strong></span></p>
	<div class="alert alert-info text-center mt-1" style="width:100%"><span class="font-weight-bold">Note:&nbsp;</span>If you need to change your battle.net account due to e.g. a name change, please contact a moderator on our Discord server.</div>
	<hr>
	<figure class="figure"><img src="/storage/app/media/Pages/Guides/Signup/3c_social.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded fr-fic fr-dii"></figure>
	<hr>

	<p dir="ltr">Finally, on the ‘Game’ tab, you can set your preferred team role and most importantly, mark yourself as participating for the upcoming season. Hold your horses though, we'll get back to that in the steps below, depending on how you want to sign up.</p>

	<p dir="ltr">If you’re on NA, you can also set your server preference. If the volume of signups in NA allow, we will use this info to sort you into groups on your preferred server based on this info, otherwise captains will decide which server to play on.</p>

	</div>
	<hr>

	<p dir="ltr"><span>Now that you have the basics down and a shiny new profile for other sloths to marvel at, let’s get into the important question of how you’re able to participate in the Lounge. Except if your goal was just to be a part of the community and spam endless sloth memes, in that case you are done here.</span></p>
	<hr>

	<h2 dir="ltr">
		<a name="ownTeam"></a>Making your own team</h2>

	<p dir="ltr"><span>If you’re bringing a group of friends, or you enjoy being the administrative sloth for a bunch of new friends, this is your preferred option of partaking in the fun.</span></p>

	<p dir="ltr">In order to create a new team, press the ‘Create Team’ button in the top right of the heroeslounge.gg homepage.</p>
	<hr>
	<figure class="figure"><img src="/storage/app/media/Pages/Guides/Signup/4_new.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded fr-fic fr-dii"></figure>
	<hr>

	<p dir="ltr">In order to make a team, you need a catchy name as well as abbreviation for our casters to use. The abbreviation can be the initials of your team name or a short form of the name, e.g. DIG for Team Dignitas.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info text-center mt-1" style="width:100%"><span class="font-weight-bold">Note:&nbsp;</span>The abbreviation is also referred to as the ‘slug’ and may already be taken, in which case you have to come up with a unique new one.</div>

	<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, you need to specify whether you’re making a team for the NA or EU league, and if you wish to do so, add a team logo, banner, description, and some social links. Naturally, you can add or edit those later through your team customization page that is very similar to the account settings we went through earlier.</p>
	<hr>
	<figure class="figure"><img src="/storage/app/media/Pages/Guides/Signup/5.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded fr-fic fr-dii"></figure>
	<hr>

	<p dir="ltr">In order not to overwhelm you with the responsibilities of a Lounge captain, there’s a handy <a href="https://heroeslounge.gg/guides/captains-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Captain’s guide</a> at your disposal if you ever feel like you need some pointers.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info text-center mt-1" style="width:100%"><span class="font-weight-bold">Note:&nbsp;</span>You can also create your own team and sign up for the season if you’re not 5 players. In this case, you have the option of finding players that fit your team on the Discord before the season starts or having our automated system assign free agents to your team to ensure you will have 5 players at the start of the season.</div>
	<hr>

	<h2 dir="ltr">
		<a name="existingTeam"></a>Participating on an existing team</h2>

	<p dir="ltr"><span>If you’re a friend of that friendly sloth that prefers to make their own team, you might not want to choose the same option but rather join them on their team. The same goes if you’re just more comfortable finding people to play with rather than letting an automated system do that for you.</span></p>

	<p>The best tool to find a new team is our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/aePkBsZ">Discord server</a>. In the Discord server there are several recruitment channels that can help you find a team:</p>

	<ul>
		<li dir="ltr"><span>#teams_recruiting(_EU or _NA depending on your preference) allows teams to post ads looking for sloths filling specific roles on their team, often in a specific skill bracket. If you find something that looks interesting here, don’t hesitate to contact the responsible captain and organising some tryouts.</span></li>
		<li dir="ltr">#players_to_recruit(_EU or _NA depending on your preference) allows you to post a lessXLFT ad that captains looking for new players can react to. Make sure to include the following information in your post in order to make it easier for captains to judge whether you would be a potential fit for their team:</li>
		<li style="list-style-type:none">
			<br>

			<ul>
				<li dir="ltr"><span>Skill bracket (HL/TL rank if you play competitive modes)</span></li>
				<li dir="ltr">HotsLogs link for an easy overview of your favourite heroes</li>
				<li dir="ltr"><span>Your preferred role(s)</span></li>
				<li dir="ltr">Availability, region/nationality (if you e.g. want to play on a non-English speaking team) and time zone.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<figure class="figure"><img src="/storage/app/media/Pages/Guides/Signup/6.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded fr-fic fr-dii"></figure>
	<hr>

	<p dir="ltr"><span>When a captain of an existing team thinks you might be a match they will send you a personal message on Discord. It is common to play some tryout games with a team before joining in order to gauge how well you mesh with the team and if there might be any problems, so if a captain doesn’t want to immediately add you to their roster, don’t fret.</span></p>

	<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;<span>Once you have found a team in this way, or if you’re just waiting for your friend to make a team, here’s how you join that team on the website:</span></p>

	<p dir="ltr">Usually, the captain of the team can add you, in which case you will have to accept the invitation in your profile settings under the ‘Applications’ tab.</p>
	<hr>
	<figure class="figure"><img src="/storage/app/media/Pages/Guides/Signup/7.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded fr-fic fr-dii"></figure>
	<hr>

	<p dir="ltr">Alternatively, you can also create an application that is then sent to your future team. If you’ve already talked to the captain of said team, which is highly recommended, all you need to do is click the button and send the application.</p>
	<hr>
	<figure class="figure"><img src="/storage/app/media/Pages/Guides/Signup/8.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded fr-fic fr-dii"></figure>
	<hr>

	<h2 dir="ltr">
		<a name="freeAgent"></a>Signing up as a free agent</h2>

	<p dir="ltr"><span>Lastly, we offer the option to sign up as a free agent, which offers the lowest effort way to play in the Lounge initially, however you need to be aware that you will have no control over who you get matched with as your teammates.</span></p>

	<p>At the start of the season all free agents will be placed into incomplete existing teams to form a roster of 5 players. All remaining players will be allocated to a FAT (free agent team) of 6 players each. When you are placed in a FAT roster try to contact the other members using their Discord IDs, even if you are not assigned as captain. This will help you bring your newfound team together. The placement into these teams is based on your MMR as well as the chosen role in your profile.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info text-center mt-1" style="width:100%"><span class="font-weight-bold">Note:&nbsp;</span>When you sign up as a free agent you will be placed in a team with other players who want to participate in the competition and count on a free agent to fill up the roster, meaning we can’t guarantee that you’ll get to play the role you set on your profile.</div>

	<p>Remember that this option is neither better nor worse than the other options, over the seasons we’ve seen FATs that have had as much success as individually formed teams. However, it does require you to be a bit more flexible and open towards your teammates though.</p>

	<p><span>If you wish to participate in Heroes Lounge as a free agent, all you need to do to sign up is to go to the ‘Game’ tab on your profile, mark the checkbox that says Season 8 (EU) participation (EU) or [NA] Season participation&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;click the ‘save’ button. In order to remind you to update your participation, there’s a pesky little notification that won’t go away until you’ve done so.</span></p>

	<hr>

	<p dir="ltr"><span>If you’re still unsure whether you’ve actually signed up or not, you can go to the season page through the top menu and check all participating free agents for the season. If you’re name is on this list, you’re good to go.</span></p>

If you ever have any questions, do not hesitate to actively use the Discord to ask in one of the existing channels or PM a moderator to get help.</em></strong></span></p>
