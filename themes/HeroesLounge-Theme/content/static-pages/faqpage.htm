It’s a fun, and informative place to go to discuss everything related to Heroes Lounge, as well as Heroes of the Storm. It's also extremely useful for getting in touch with your opponents. We recommend everyone be available on our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/aePkBsZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discord server</a> at least during their match.</div></div></div>

				<p>Heroes Lounge is currently operating in Europe and North America. As such we expect players to have their main account on either the European or North American servers and must be available at reasonable times to play their opponents and practice with their team for their region. Past experience has shown most players from different regions encounter problems with hero pools, availability and ping when playing on a different region server.</p>

However, you still have to schedule the match within the first week, otherwise your team will go inactive. You may put in a placeholder date for that purpose.</div></div></div>

				<p>That’s unfortunate. Sadly, some signups don’t show up. In case this happens in your team, the best course of action is to try and add a new player to your roster as soon as possible. Check out the #players_to_recruit channel on our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/aePkBsZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discord</a> if there are free agents still looking for a team and put a message out in #teams_recruiting that your team in looking to recruit a player. If you are still 4 players and the match is coming up, you are allowed to use a substitute, check out the <a href="https://heroeslounge.gg/general/ruleset" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rules</a> page for the rules on substitute players.</p>

				<p>Third, one of the captains sets up a custom game and invites all the players to it. Ensure that both teams/captains are correct, select Tournament Draft and select the correct team to have first pick.</p>

				<p>In our efforts to balance between the needs of the teams, the lounge and the casters, we've decided to separate the casters into 2 groups: Lounge casters and External casters.</p>

				<p>Lounge casters are casters who were vetted by our Heads of Casters and are allowed to cast any team they wish without teams being able to decline them with the exception of their own team, which they are not allowed to cast.</p>

				<p>However, in the case of External casters, teams can decline the External caster.</p>
